        <h1>TheCompany.com Balance and TheCompany.com Gift Card Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <p>The following are the terms and conditions applicable to your TheCompany.com Balance and TheCompany.com Gift Cards. By purchasing, accepting, or using a Gift Card, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions on behalf of yourself and all members of your household and others who purchase, accept, or use a Gift Card under your account.</p>

        <h2>1. Gift Cards; TheCompany.com Balance; Redemption</h2>
        <p>TheCompany.com Gift Cards are issued by ACI Gift Cards LLC, a Washington limited liability company, and include TheCompany.com Gift Cards that are automatically added to your TheCompany.com Balance when you "reload" your balance, receive an "allowance," or use a "TheCompany Cash" barcode ("Gift Cards"). Your TheCompany.com Balance displays the total remaining balance of all Gift Cards that have been applied to your TheCompany.com account but not yet applied to a purchase. We may refer to your TheCompany.com Balance as your "TheCompany Balance," "Gift Card balance," or "GC Balance." To view your TheCompany.com Balance, visit Your Account on TheCompany.com. Purchases are deducted from your TheCompany.com Balance. Any unused TheCompany.com Balance will remain associated with your TheCompany.com account. If a purchase exceeds your TheCompany.com Balance, the remaining amount must be paid with another payment method.</p>

        <h2>2. Limitations</h2>
        <p>Your TheCompany.com Balance cannot be used to purchase other Gift Cards, prepaid open loop cards, or certain third-party gift cards. Gift Cards cannot be reloaded; resold; used for payment outside of TheCompany.com or its affiliated properties; used for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes, promotional or commercial purposes, including to facilitate the resale or shipment of goods from TheCompany.com; redeemed for more than face value; transferred for value; redeemed for cash; or used in a manner prohibited by TheCompany.com Gift Card Restrictions and Prohibited Activities policy. No portion of your TheCompany.com Balance may be transferred to another TheCompany.com account. Neither your TheCompany.com Balance nor your Gift Cards may be applied to the purchase of goods or services at any TheCompany-affiliated property outside of the United States.</p>

        <h2>3. Risk of Loss</h2>
        <p>The risk of loss and title for Gift Cards pass to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission of the Gift Card to the purchaser or designated recipient, or our delivery to the carrier, whichever is applicable. Gift Cards must be obtained from TheCompany or an authorized third party, and you are responsible for safeguarding your TheCompany.com Balance or Gift Card from unauthorized use. We are not responsible if any Gift Card is lost, stolen, or destroyed, or if your TheCompany.com Balance or any Gift Card is used without your permission. There are a variety of Gift Card scams that request payment by Gift Card. TheCompany is not responsible for, and assumes no liability to you for, any unlawful conduct or fraud by any third party associated with any Gift Card.</p>

        <h2>4. Use of TheCompany.com Balance or any Gift Card in Violation of these Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>By using a Gift Card you agree to comply with these terms and conditions, and not to use a Gift Card in any manner that is misleading, deceptive, unfair, or otherwise harmful to TheCompany.com, its affiliates, or its customers. We reserve the right, without notice to you, to void Gift Cards (including as a component of your TheCompany.com Balance) without a refund, suspend or terminate customer accounts, or suspend or terminate the ability to use our services, cancel or limit orders, and bill alternative forms of payment if we suspect that a Gift Card is obtained, used, or applied to an account fraudulently, unlawfully, or otherwise in violation of these terms and conditions.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">To the full extent permissible by law, we make no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the gift cards or your TheCompany.com balance, including without limitation any express or implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. To the full extent permissible by law, in the event a gift card is non-functional, your sole remedy, and our sole liability, will be the replacement of that gift card.</span></p>

        <h2>6. Disputes</h2>
        <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to Gift Cards or your TheCompany.com Balance will be resolved by the dispute resolution terms in the TheCompany.com Conditions of Use.</p>

        <h2>7. General Terms</h2>
        <p>The TheCompany.com Conditions of Use apply. No fees apply to Gift Cards. We reserve the right to require additional verification of your identity, Gift Card or account ownership, or provision of an additional payment instrument, before you are able to apply a Gift Card to your account or your TheCompany.com Balance to a purchase. When you purchase, receive, or apply a Gift Card to your account, or your TheCompany.com Balance to a purchase, you agree that the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these terms and conditions and any dispute that may arise between you and ACI Gift Cards LLC, and its affiliates related to your use of a Gift Card or your TheCompany.com Balance. We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions without notice, from time to time at our sole discretion. All terms and conditions are applicable to the extent permitted by law. If any of these terms and conditions are deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that unenforceable term will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining terms and conditions.</p>

        <h2>8. TheCompany.com Balance Expiration</h2>
        <p>The portion of your TheCompany.com Balance made up of Gift Cards issued after October 1, 2005 does not expire and may be applied to your TheCompany.com account and applied to eligible purchases despite any stated expiration date. Expiration dates also do not apply for the portion of your TheCompany.com Balance made up of any Gift Cards issued prior to October 1, 2005 in CA, CT, LA, ME, MD, MA, MT, NH, ND, OK, RI, VT, WA, or in any other jurisdiction solely to the extent prohibited or limited by law. All other Gift Cards issued prior to October 1, 2005 and the portion of your TheCompany.com Balance made up of those Gift Cards expire in accordance with their stated terms.</p>
